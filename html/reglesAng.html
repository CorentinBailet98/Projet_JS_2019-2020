            The goal of the game is simple, you have to get your opponent out
            of the red circle</strong> (3 times to win). Or to recover the most <strong>boosts</strong>.<br>
            For this purpose, boosts will appear randomly
            on the carpet. You can accumulate up to <strong>3 boosts</strong> at most. <br>
            A match that lasts 1/2 minutes<burn>
            If at the end of the time both players are out the
            same number of times, the winner is the one who has
            to accumulate the most boosts.

                The different functions of the boost: <br>
                (number of boost(s) to be used)
                <li>
                    With 1 boost you can make an <strong>acceleration</strong> on
                    a short distance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With 2 boosts you can make a <strong>switch</strong>, the switch
                    allows you (during a collision with the opponent)
                    to exchange your position with the opponent's
                    while keeping the same direction of travel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With 3 boosts it is possible to make a <strong>propulsion</strong>
                    that sends the opponent far enough away.
                    Both players will be "knocked out" after the attack which 
                    means that you have to press on a button to get
                    move again.
